# Mission and Task Lifecycle

**Capability statement**: The buildd coordination layer MUST enforce the defined
state machines for both tasks and missions, allowing only documented transitions,
deriving mission health from live task state (never storing it), and unblocking
downstream DAG tasks when a task reaches a terminal state.

---

## Task State Machine

**States**: `pending` → `assigned` | `claimed` → `in_progress` → `review` →
`completed` | `failed`

The authoritative status string is `tasks.status`. The schema uses `text` (not
an enum) to allow extension without migrations.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Available for a runner to claim. |
| `assigned` | Reserved for a specific runner (not yet started). |
| `claimed` | Claimed optimistically; worker row being created. |
| `in_progress` | Worker has started (runner transitions via PATCH). |
| `running` | Worker is actively running (worker status, not task). |
| `review` | Output submitted; awaiting human review. |
| `completed` | Terminal: deliverable produced (or promoted from stale worker with deliverables). |
| `failed` | Terminal: all retry attempts exhausted or permanent error. |

**Invariants**:
- A task with `dependsOn` set MUST remain `pending` (non-claimable) until all
  listed task IDs are `completed`.
- `claimedBy` MUST be set atomically with `status = 'claimed'` using an
  `UPDATE … WHERE status = 'pending'` optimistic lock.
- A task with an active worker (status in `running`, `starting`, `waiting_input`,
  `idle`) MUST NOT be reset to `pending` while that worker is alive.
- `outputRequirement = 'pr_required'` MUST block `complete_task` unless
  `workers.prUrl` is set.
- A task transitions to `failed` permanently after `MAX_WORKER_RETRIES = 3`
  failed workers with no deliverables.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- AC-1: GIVEN a task with `dependsOn: [taskA]` and `taskA.status = 'pending'`
  WHEN `claim_task` is called THEN the task is NOT returned (still blocked).
- AC-2: GIVEN `taskA.status` transitions to `completed` WHEN
  `resolveCompletedTask` runs THEN the dependent task's status becomes `pending`
  and a `task:unblocked` Pusher event is fired.
- AC-3: GIVEN `outputRequirement = 'pr_required'` and `prUrl` is null WHEN
  `complete_task` is called THEN the server returns an error — the task is NOT
  completed.
- AC-4: GIVEN a task that has had 3 prior `failed` workers WHEN the 4th worker
  is marked stale THEN `tasks.status = 'failed'` (permanent, no more retries).
- AC-5: GIVEN a concurrent claim race WHEN two runners call `claim_task`
  simultaneously THEN exactly one succeeds and the other receives an appropriate
  error or empty result.

**Code surface**:
- Claim route: `apps/web/src/app/api/workers/claim/route.ts`
- Worker update (PATCH): `apps/web/src/app/api/workers/[id]/route.ts`
- Dependency resolution: `apps/web/src/lib/task-dependencies.ts` —
  `resolveCompletedTask()`
- Stale reclaim: `apps/web/src/lib/stale-workers.ts` — `resolveStaleTask()`
- Schema: `packages/core/db/schema.ts` — `tasks` table

## Worker State Machine

Workers are execution sessions. A worker's `status` is separate from the task
status and tracks the agent's runtime state:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `idle` | Worker row created; agent not yet started. |
| `starting` | Runner is launching the agent. |
| `running` | Agent is actively processing. |
| `waiting_input` | Agent paused, waiting for a human response. |
| `completed` | Agent finished successfully. |
| `failed` | Agent or runner encountered a terminal error. |
| `error` | System-level error (distinct from agent failure). |

**Invariants**:
- A terminal worker (`completed`, `failed`, `error`) MUST NOT accept status
  updates except a single `running` reactivation (for follow-up messages from
  the runner, with a guard on `isCleanupExpiry`).
- `waitingFor` MUST be cleared (`null`) automatically when status transitions
  to `running`.
- `workers.startedAt` is set the first time status becomes `running`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- AC-6: GIVEN `worker.status = 'failed'` WHEN a PATCH with `status = 'running'`
  is received THEN the reactivation is allowed ONLY if the caller passes the
  cleanup-expiry guard; otherwise HTTP 409 is returned.
- AC-7: GIVEN `worker.status = 'waiting_input'` WHEN a PATCH with
  `status = 'running'` arrives THEN `waitingFor` is set to `null` in the same
  update.

**Code surface**:
- PATCH handler: `apps/web/src/app/api/workers/[id]/route.ts`
- Reactivation guard: same file, lines ~88–109

## Mission State Machine

**States**: `active` → `paused` → `active` (reversible) | `completed` →
`archived`

Mission `status` is stored in `missions.status`. Mission **health** is NEVER
stored — it is derived on read from the state of associated tasks via
`deriveMissionHealth` / `isDeliverableTask`.

**Invariants**:
- Mission status transitions (`active ↔ paused`, `active → completed`,
  `completed → archived`) are driven by human action (dashboard or MCP) or
  mission loop evaluation tasks — not by any automatic side effect.
- Health is computed from deliverable tasks only (`isDeliverableTask` filters out
  `kind = 'coordination'`, `mode = 'planning'`, and housekeeping titles).
- A paused mission MUST NOT spawn new tasks from its schedule while paused.
- `missions.workingBranch` and `primaryPrNumber` track the shared branch for
  all tasks under the mission; they are generated lazily on first task creation.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- AC-8: GIVEN a mission with all tasks `completed` WHEN health is derived THEN
  the health reflects 100% completion (no failed deliverable tasks).
- AC-9: GIVEN a `planning` mode task linked to a mission WHEN health is derived
  THEN that task is excluded from the deliverable count.
- AC-10: GIVEN `missions.status = 'paused'` WHEN the cron schedule fires THEN
  no new task is created for that mission.
- AC-11: GIVEN a mission with `requiresReview = true` WHEN a task PR is created
  THEN auto-merge is suppressed and human review is required before merging.

**Code surface**:
- Mission helpers: `packages/core/mission-helpers.ts` — `isDeliverableTask()`
- Mission context: `apps/web/src/lib/mission-context.ts`
- Mission API: `apps/web/src/app/api/missions/route.ts`,
  `apps/web/src/app/api/missions/[id]/route.ts`
- Schema: `packages/core/db/schema.ts` — `missions` table

## `deriveMissionHealth` contract

**Capability statement**: `deriveMissionHealth` MUST compute the health of a
mission from its live task list without reading from any stored health column.

**Invariants**:
- Only deliverable tasks (`isDeliverableTask()` returns `true`) count.
- A mission with zero deliverable tasks MUST return a "no tasks" or "empty"
  health signal (not "healthy").

**Acceptance criteria**:
- AC-12: GIVEN tasks `[{status:'completed'}, {status:'failed'}, {kind:'coordination'}]`
  WHEN health is derived THEN the coordination task is excluded and health
  reflects 1 completed, 1 failed deliverable.
- AC-13: GIVEN a task with `title: 'Aggregate results: …'` WHEN `isDeliverableTask`
  is called THEN it returns `false`.

**Code surface**:
- `packages/core/mission-helpers.ts` — `isDeliverableTask()`

**Out of scope**: Sub-missions (`parentMissionId`) lifecycle. Mission heartbeat
scheduling (covered by `task-schedules`). The mission loop orchestration agent
logic (runner-side, not coordination layer).
